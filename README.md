Get the minimum value of a list of numbers

A new Dart project.

## Getting Started

This project helps you detect the minimum number in a list of integer numbers with these steps:
1. Create a function called "calculate_min" that takes a list of integer numbers as parameter and calculates the minimum number in it
2. Define a "minimum" variable to store a number with a very high value which is 99999999
3. Create a for loop to iterate in the list of numbers
4. Check if the current number of the list is smaller than the current number stored in "minimum" variable
5. If so, store this number in the "minimum" variable
6. finally, return the final minimum variable
7. After that, create the main function and do the following steps inside it
8. Create a list of integer numbers
9. Call the "calculate_min" function and send the list as a parameter to calculate the minimum number and store it in the "minimum_number" variable
10. Print a message contains the value of the minimum number
